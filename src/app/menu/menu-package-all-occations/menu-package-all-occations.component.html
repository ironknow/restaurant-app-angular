			<h1>Menu packages for all occasions</h1>
			<h4>These are menu items we offer here at Kamayan sa Palaisdaan</h4>
			<br><br>
			<h5 class="text-left">The menu consists mostly of fish, since Tayabas is known for their light and delectable seafood compared to Lucban's meat fest. Big winners are the Inihaw na Pla-Pla (also known as tilapia), and the inihaw na Hito. All his cooks are native chefs, so one can expect an authentic taste of Tayabas in their dishes. Other dishes, worthy of praise are the Inihaw na Spare Ribs, Squid in Oyster Sauce, and their own version of Salpicao (mixed vegatable &
			 seafoods). </h5>
